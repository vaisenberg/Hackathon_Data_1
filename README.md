# We analyzed data from various regions worldwide 
# to understand how protein consumption is influenced
# by factors such as income per capita, food availability, 
# and urbanization levels. 
# The results revealed significant regional disparities. 
# We also applied machine learning models to our analysis.
# Models like XGBoost demonstrated high accuracy in predicting 
# economic indicators based on data about protein intake and 
# overall food supply.
